Years ago, we were promised to have flying cars.
It’s 2022 and it’s still not a thing. But…

What about rethinking what we believed in for years would be the best solution for cities cramping more and more?
1. Public transport — many kinds of research have shown that the easiest way to improve transportation in the city is making public transport more affordable and cheaper.
The cheapest kind of it would be to create dedicated bus lanes and optimize their schedule.
Then we have all kinds of rail-based systems like trams, metro, or light railways (London is doing this extremely well)
2. Robo-taxis — as it’s not always possible to cover entire cities with dense networks of bus lines and people have different needs, there’s increasing interest in robo-taxis: think about it as a complementary to public transport, rather than competitive. We have [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) already available in Phoenix, AZ, there’s Intel’s Mobieye working with Geely on autonomous cars, Tesla is working on their FSD and we have companies like [Canoo](https://workingreen.jobs/companies/canoo) that completely redesign what we think a car is.
3. Bold one: flying taxis — this is, in my opinion, more suitable for metro areas and bigger cities (Tokyo, Los Angeles, NYC, London, Paris)
This is a more (eco-friendly) alternative to helicopters, but with scale big enough it may be more affordable for people. Uber presented their Elevate project a few years ago, but it was acquired by [Joby Aviation](https://workingreen.jobs/companies/joby-aviation)
