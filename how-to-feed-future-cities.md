It's projected that close to 7 billion people will live in urban areas in 2050. People tend to migrate from rural to urban areas as they become richer.
 
And these people will have to eat something - current way of food production is a source of huge chunk of greenhouse gases and water pollution.
Agriculture accounts for 70% of total water consumption worldwide and is the single-largest contributor of non-point-source pollution to surface water and groundwater. 
Between people attempting to keep their yards vibrant green and weed-free, and farmers coping with the growing population, fertilizers play a large roll in the cause of water pollution on this planet. The result is dangerous algae blooms which eventually lead to the extinction of many underwater plants, as well as fish.

There's also issue with deforestation - many forests are being cut down for soy beans and other food for animals.

But such approach is not sustainable, our planet won't feed so many people, especially as people getting reacher tend to eat more meat.  

What can we do to improve our situation and feed billions of people living in the cities?

### What options do we have?


We have quite a few - indoors, container farming in the cities, insect-based diet, plant-based meat replacements, out-of-city grown products from local farmers (to replace food transportation over hundreds of miles) - let's review few of them

#### Container farming
- Freight Farms
- Bowery Farming
- Square Roots
