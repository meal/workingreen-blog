### What is a green job?

You may have heard the term "green jobs", but are you sure you know what does it mean?

According to [ILO](https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/green-jobs/news/WCMS_220248/lang--en/index.htm "International Labour Organization") (International Labour Organization) a green job is one that contribute to preserve or restore the environment:

>Green jobs help:
>* Improve energy and raw materials efficiency
>* Limit greenhouse gas emissions
>* Minimize waste and pollution
>* Protect and restore ecosystems
>* Support adaptation to the effects of climate change

All jobs in the future will need to be green jobs to meet environmental targets.

According to a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency there are 10.3 million renewable energy jobs globally﻿ – a 5.3 % increase since 2017.

Over the next decade, we expect to see millions of new jobs created globally due to new climate policies and commitments. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that 24 million jobs worldwide could be created by the green economy by 2030 alone.
