 By 2050 it's projected that more than two-thirds of the world population will live in urban areas. It's projected that close to 7 billion people will live in urban areas in 2050. People tend to migrate from rural to urban areas as they become richer.
 
And these people will have to eat something - current way of food production is a source of huge chunk of greenhouse gases and water pollution.
Agriculture accounts for 70% of total water consumption worldwide and is the single-largest contributor of non-point-source pollution to surface water and groundwater. 
Between people attempting to keep their yards vibrant green and weed-free, and farmers coping with the growing population, fertilizers play a large roll in the cause of water pollution on this planet. The result is dangerous algae blooms which eventually lead to the extinction of many underwater plants, as well as fish.

There's also issue with deforestation - many forests are being cut down for soy beans and other food for animals.

But such approach is not sustainable, our planet won't feed so many people, especially as people getting reacher tend to eat more meat.

We have other options too - indoor, container farming in the cities, insect-based diet, plant-based meat replacements
